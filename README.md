# NLP-sentiment-analysis
### Didactic project to understand the different technologies involved in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

A sentiment analysis has been carried out for a dataset of video game reviews on Amazon. The work pipeline has been:

1. Notebook1_Download_EDA. Dataset download, dataframe loading and exploratory analysis of the set.
2. NotebookTwo_Preprocessing. Creation of a pipeline function that processes the data before being used in the models.
3. Notebook3_Model_Training. Creation of two models and obtaining results. The first is a classical logistic regression machine learning model. The second is a recurrent neural network with a word embedding layer created with a word2vec.
4. Notebook 4_Metrics and conclusions. Analysis of the metrics and results obtained. Work proposals for future versions of the models.
